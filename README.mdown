Everyone we know has been excited by [Realmac Software][]'s beautiful new todo-list app [Clear][] hit the App Store. Thoughtfully deconstructed UI, intuitive gestures, and beautiful animations make for a wonderful product that surprises and delights users.

Being a fan of rich user experiences, we spent a day building a quick prototype of Clear's primary user interaction:

- Multi-gesture recognition
- Pull down to create
- Pinch open to reveal a cell
- Pinch closed to close a cell
- Animated folding & flipping cells

It looks a little something like this:

How did you do that?
--------------------

Glad you asked! The mechanics behind this are relatively simple. Start with Core Animation layers, sprinkle in basic trig, stir in some gesture recognizers, bake for 30 minutes at 450&deg; and you're done!

Before implementing anything in Core Animation, especially anything in three dimensions, you should draw it out on paper from the front and the side. The Clear app has four different cell states in the todo list which I've named flat ( | ), fold back ( &#92; ), pinch ( < ), and fold up ( / ). At first you might think we need to implement some sort of CAFlatLayer, CAPinchLayer, and CAFoldLayer but these can all be very cleanly abstracted into four different states of the same class. In fact, it turns out they can all use the exact same two lines of trig & two simple transforms:

    CGFloat theta = acosf(y/l);
    CGFloat z = l * sinf(theta);    

    …
    
	CATransform3D transform = CATransform3DMakeTranslation(0.0, 0.0, z);
	self.topHalfLayer.transform = CATransform3DRotate(transform, topAngle, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
	self.bottomHalfLayer.transform = CATransform3DRotate(transform, bottomAngle, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
    

Four different sexy animations in five lines of code. I told you the mechanics were simple! Each state is just a matter of how far back we push the anchor point [ l * sin(&theta;) ] and the angle we need to rotate our layers towards or away from the user [ &theta; = cos<sup>-1</sup>(currentheight/originalheight)]. Let's walk through how this works. 

Our folding layer is composed of two sublayers, topHalfLayer & bottomHalfLayer, both of which contain appropriately positioned and clipped copies of our text layer.

In order to make the 3D projections line up properly and dramatically simplify the math, we change the anchor points of the layers to align with the center of our parent folding layer. For those of you following along at home, that's (0.5, 1) for the top layer and (0.5,0) for the bottom layer. If we don't transform anything we already have the flat layer.

1 down, 3 to go. As we shrink the height of our layer, we need to rotate the layers back by the appropriate &theta; so they still fit. You might be tempted to just skip the 3D and squish them trust us, that approach will only end in tears. To get the pinch effect we rotate the front and back layers by the appropriate &theta; and -&theta; so the layer halves stay the same height. This puts the layers in front of the screen so we need to translate the layers back by z = &#189; h * sin(&theta;) where h is the original height of the flat layer. That's 2 down. If we want to fold instead of pinch, translate the layers back by z and rotate both layers by &theta; or -&theta; and they will like up. As you can see above, that's just 1 CATransform3DMakeTranslation and 1 CATransform3DRotate per layer half and we're done. For a better view of each state:

What about pinching and stuff?
------------------------------

The use of intuitive and contextually appropriate gestures are what make Clear really shine. Gesture management in the past was done through intercepting touch events and doing your best to figure out what they are. These days we get to use UIGestureRecognizers which make things a lot easier. Specifically, we need a UIPinchGestureRecognizer and a UIPanGestureRecognizer. We'll first need a view to capture the gestures. This example uses a full screen UIScrollView for bouncing and scrolling large lists and adds a bunch of our folding layers directly to the scrollview's layer. Next up you create a new layer when a gesture begins, adjust the size of your layer when the gesture changes, and finalize/delete the layer when the gesture has ended. At the end of each gesture change state we relayout our layer frames. Thanks to Core Animation our layers will animate between states for you automatically.

Want to learn more? The nitty-gritty is all in the code. There's a bit more about how we interpolate colors, how we track the gestures, how we selectively allow certain animations at specific times, and how we create and clean up layers. All told this is a couple hundred lines of code so it should be a fairly quick read.

Give me the code!

We explicitly left out some details to make things more clear, as this is just an example. If this were a production app, some obvious improvements would be:

* Layers should track finger locations when pinching to create layers rather than using the pinch scale.
* Use UIViews backed by custom CALayers instead of using raw layers in our view hierarchy.
* Support arbitrary view hierarchies and avoid this two-text-field trick by rendering the cell contents into an image and using that as the layer contents while animating.
* We could create a MHFoldingTableView with a datasource and delegate and move our layer/cell layout into that view instead of the gesture recognizer.

We could show how to do more Clear-like things:

* Side swipe to mark completed
* Make layers editable
* Pinch-down to shrink the list into a single cell in a larger list
* Add sounds, themes, and more

But again… this was meant as an example to illustrate some CoreAnimation & UIGestureRecognizer basics, not to rebuild Clear.
